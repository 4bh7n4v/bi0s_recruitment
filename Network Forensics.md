# Process:
Unzipped the file to get the .pcap.

Opened it with Wireshark.

Went through the packets and at the 5th Serial number there was a message stating the key was 5.

The I went through the rest of the packets and there I found a suspected which supposedly looks like the flag and that was `gn0x{s3yb0wp_nsyjwhjuynts_l0jx_g00rc0c0}?` after using a ceaser cipher with a shift of 5 letters I found the flag.
#Flag Found 
`bi0s{n3tw0rk_interception_g0es_b00mx0x0}`
